# Document converter APIs
Welcome to the Document Converter API! This service specializes in converting documents into digestible text chunks, making them ready for further processing. This service makes use of the Docling library; check it out [**here**](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling). Letâ€™s dive in the APIs! ðŸŒŸ

    - `up_time`: runtime of the service (in seconds).
    - `status`: `"healthy"` means the service is good to go; `"unhealthy"` means something's wrong.
